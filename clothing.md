## Brands:

### Nanotrasen Systems, Inc.
A juggernaut in basically every market, Nanotrasen's forey into clothing started the moment it's eyes expanded into other markets that weren't strictly science related. Cheap, dirty, efficent, a bare basic run-down of usually one primary-colour jumpsuits, with a soft spot shown for the drab-colour of grey.

Nanotrasen has been accused of questionable labour practices regarding it's clothing. Journalists of the Lunar Sun discovered a workshop on the under-side of Luna, using prepubescent workers to produce jumpsuits very simmilar to the one's produced by Nanotrasen. These accusations have been denied. 

Ever since it's beginning, Nanotrasen has prided itself on it's expensive, and elaborate clothing for it's Command and CentCom staff. Outsourced in expensive contracts, usually to designer and luxury brands.

### Inferno
A designer brand in the modern age, headquarted in the cultural hotspot of Sol-3's New York City. Contempory and youthful with it's start in 2641, it's founder, and current CEO: a woman from Earth named Harley, was a fashion designer and bureaucrat, annoyed at the blandness of women's clothing.

Stylised with a mixture of red, and black with a a mixture of occult imagery. Inferno quickly became a popular and powerful clothing brand, especially with the new generation of women. In 2648, Inferno won a contract sent out by Nanotrasen, to produce women's clothing for Command and CentCom staff.

### Excellent
Streetwear, embodied. With a long, and ardious history, Excellent is a direct decendent of most major luxury clothing brands that exist in SolFed's history. In 2162, the company known as Supreme had became a juggernaut in the luxury market, overpowering and outspending other brands. Enough so that it could aquire most of them in one of the biggest corporate mergers known to the history of man.
