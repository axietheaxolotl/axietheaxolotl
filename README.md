hi, my name's [no], but you can call me AxieTheAxolotl. i'm an australian graphic designer, but i also contribute sprite/artwork to certain things.

this mostly includes the old ass game <a href="https://spacestation13.com">Space Station 13</a>, an old game written in dm about paranoia and roleplay. don't play it.
